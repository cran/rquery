\title{Make an orderby node (not a relational operation).}
\usage{
orderby(source, cols = NULL, ..., rev_cols = NULL, limit = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{source}{source to select from.}

\item{cols}{order by column names.}

\item{...}{force later arguments to be bound by name}

\item{rev_cols}{order by reverse of these column names.}

\item{limit}{number limit row count.}
}
\value{
select columns node.
}
\description{
Order a table by a set of columns (not general expressions) and
limit number of rows in that order.
}
\details{
Note: this is a relational operator in that it takes a table that
is a relation (has unique rows) to a table that is still a relation.
However, most relational systems do not preserve row order in storage or between
operations.  So without the limit set this is not a useful operator except
as a last step prior ot pulling data to an in-memory \code{data.frame} (
which does preserve row order).

\examples{

if (requireNamespace("RSQLite", quietly = TRUE)) {
  my_db <- DBI::dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(), ":memory:")
  d <- dbi_copy_to(my_db, 'd',
                   data.frame(AUC = 0.6, R2 = 0.2))
  eqn <- orderby(d, rev_cols = "AUC", limit=4)
  cat(format(eqn))
  sql <- to_sql(eqn, my_db)
  cat(sql)
  print(DBI::dbGetQuery(my_db, sql))
  DBI::dbDisconnect(my_db)
}
